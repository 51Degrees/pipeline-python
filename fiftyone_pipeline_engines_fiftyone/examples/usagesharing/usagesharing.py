#
# Usage sharing is enabled by default if using some 51Degrees pipeline 
# builders such as the [DeviceDetectionOnPremisePipelineBuilder](https://github.com/51Degrees/device-detection-python/blob/master/fiftyone_devicedetection_onpremise/fiftyone_devicedetection_onpremise/devicedetection_onpremise_pipelinebuilder.py).
# In this example, we show how to specifically add a usage sharing 
# element to a Pipeline using configuration.
#
# As with all flow elements, this can also be handled in code, 
# using the constructor parameters. The commented section in the 
# example demonstrates this.
#
# The 51d.json file contains all the configuration options.
# These are all optional, so each can be omitted if the default 
# for that option is sufficient:
#
# @include usagesharing/51d.json
#
# For details of what each setting does, see the constructor
# parameters in the reference documentation for the 
# [share usage element](http://51degrees.com/pipeline-python/classpipeline-python_1_1fiftyone__pipeline__engines__fiftyone_1_1fiftyone__pipeline__engines__fibec5ad82b73105e146420c12840758d4.html) 
#
# This example is available in full on [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/pipeline-python/blob/master/fiftyone_pipeline_engines_fiftyone/examples/usagesharing/usagesharing.py).
#
# Expected output:
# ```
# Constructing pipeline from configuration file.
# 
# Pipeline created with share usage element. Evidence processed 
# with this pipeline will now be shared with 51Degrees using the 
# specified configuration.
# ```
